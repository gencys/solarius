## SOLARIUS

Solarius is a custom kernel for the EZFlash Omega Definitive edition. It was forked from [Simple](https://github.com/Sterophonick/omega-de-kernel) by [Sterophonick](https://github.com/Sterophonick).

The goal of this custom kernel is three fold:

   1. Document the EZFlash kernel as much as possible for posterity.
   2. Flashcart interfaces don't need to be ugly, let's make a nice one.
   3. Make the cart available in more languages.

### Caveats

The this kernel is not ready yet, so don't try to clone the repo and build the thing just yet.

Take a look at the [original README](./original_README.md).
